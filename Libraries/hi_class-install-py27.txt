Once you have a version of cosmosis which uses python 2.7, you should download this repository: https://github.com/itrharrison/hi_class

Which is best done by running:

	git clone https://github.com/itrharrison/hi_class.git

You should then make sure you have cosmosis set up:

	conda activate cosmosis

Then navigate to the directory which you have downloaded the repository, then:

	cd hi_class_public

then:

	make

This should compile the hi_class code as necessary.

You can check if this has been successful by navigating to the hi_class/inis directory and running:

	cosmosis example-hi_class.ini

But before doing this you will need to make a couple of changes to example-hi_class.ini reflecting where you have installed it on your own computer.

In the [hi_class] section of the ini, you need to tell it the correct location of the files. So changing line 27:

	file = /Users/harrison/Dropbox/code_mcr/hi_class/hi_class_interface.py

and line 28:
	
	sBBN_file = /Users/harrison/Dropbox/code_mcr/hi_class/hi_class_public/bbn/sBBN.dat

to the actual locations of those two files on your machine. You may find it useful to navigate to the hi_class directory where you downloaded the repo and run

	pwd

which will show the full directory location.
