# Updating Gravitational Wave Constraints on Modified Gravity

We use the following events; GW170817 and GW190521 to constrain gravity theories for this project. GW190521 is by far the farthest detected merger made by Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors during O3. 
It has a luminosity distance of 4-5 Gpc. The discovery is linked to the merger of two black holes, resulting in an intermediate mass black hole. ZTF19abanrhr is the tentative EM equivalents connected with GW190521 at redshift z = 0.438. 
It is created by the collision between two black holes in an AGN disc. By assuming that GW190521 and ZTF19abanrhr are connected with much the same astrophysical source, we can constrain modified theories of gravity. 
Throughout the process, we pay particular attention to the two questions listed below:

1) How much does it constrain on alpha_M Horndeski parameter by the inclusion of the GW event GW190521 as a standard siren.
2) Constraints on coeficients apperaring on alpha_M and alpha_B Horndeski parameters and plotting the contours corresponding to constraints from LIGO-Virgo data.


In conjunction to the gravitational wave data, we even incorporate restrictions from a pair of recent cosmology large scale data sets. This serves as context for the stricter constraints they offer for the alpha_M Horndeski parameter as well as additional constraints on cosmological parameters. They are the prime source of constraints for the alpha_B Horndeski parameter which do not influence the propagation of Gravitational Waves.


Cosmosis and hiclass libraries were used extensively for the project. For installation of these libraries you can check the /Libraries
